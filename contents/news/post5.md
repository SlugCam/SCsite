The new custom daughter card has been finalized! This will allow all new slugcam nodes the ability to have all needed external components and IC logic on a easly pluggable daughter card. Say goodbye to the rats nest of wires as shown in our previous prototype. You can see our logo on the underside of the board in this photo:

Once we receive funding to build the nodes we plan on buying the parts to get SlugCam v2 finalized and deployed!
