  <dt>[SlugCam on GitHub](https://github.com/SlugCam)</dt>
  	<dd>All of our code is currently hosted on GitHub</dd>
  <dt><b>Raspberry Pi Foundation website</b></dt>
  	<dd>Using the Pi as our main processing unit we found the [forums](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/) helpful.</dd>
  <dt><b>TI's MSP430 Micro-controller</b></dt>
  	<dd>Our second processing unit needed to be extremely power efficient and as a common choice we decided to go with the [MSP430](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpads-msp430.html) from Texas Instruments.</dd>
  <dt><b>Buildroot Embedded Linux</b></dt>
  	<dd>Buildroot, a tool for making custom embedded Linux systems, found [here](http://buildroot.uclibc.org/) was used in the first iterations of SlugCam.</dd>
  <dt><b>Arch Linux</b></dt>
  	<dd>New versions of SlugCam use [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Raspberry_Pi) for ease of development along with achieving similar performance as buildroot.</dd>
  <dt><b>OpenCV</b></dt>
  	<dd>Our open source computer vision module makes use of the very popular [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/) API to do object detection when we are recording video.</dd>
  <dt><b>AngularJS</b></dt>
  	<dd>Our web interface makes use of the open source javascript framework [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)</dd>
