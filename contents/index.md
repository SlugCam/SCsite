### Project

In the middle of February 2013 a series of crimes occurred on the Campus of the University
of California Santa Cruz in a short period of time. This Spur of events inspired us to try and assist the safety of
students on campus by deploying sensor networks in the more remote parts of campus where crimes usually
happen. In these areas there are no power grid points or available wired internet, so we designed our nodes
to make use of available solar energy and have the ability to receive a wireless connection from a directional antennae. With a large enough rechargeable battery, and efficient device
powering control, our system is able to monitor an area while never needing battery replacements. We found
video sensing gave us the best data set to detect events, so our device makes use of open source computer
vision software to detect anomalies. 

Although SlugCam's initial research and design was intended to be part of Kevin Abas' master thesis, other interns and
undergraduates of UCSC have also made separate contributions. Please meet the team in the "Contributors" section of this website. 


SlugCam is currently being developed in the [i-NRG
lab](http://inrg.cse.ucsc.edu/inrgwiki) at the University of California, Santa
Cruz. Our goal is to design smarter video sensor networks for numerous outdoor applications. Environmental and wildlife monitoring
is another area we believe our devices would be of help and we seek to taylor to those applications in the near future as well!
